# NESMIDI
Uses an NES controller as a MIDI controller.

Based MIDI controller off of Notes and Volts' MIDI controller (https://www.notesandvolts.com/).

This is still in testing phase so there's a lot of testing functions and commented-out functions, I haven't had time to work on it in awhile. I'll come back to it at some point.
